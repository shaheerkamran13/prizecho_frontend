      <p style={{ fontSize: "14px", color: "#666" }}>Last Updated: [Date]</p>
      
      <h2 style={{ fontSize: "20px", marginTop: "20px", marginBottom: "10px" }}>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This Wallet Policy ("Policy") outlines the terms and conditions for using the wallet services provided by 
        <strong> Prizecho.com</strong> ("we," "our," "us"). By using our wallet services, you agree to comply with this Policy. 
        If you do not agree with any part of this Policy, please refrain from using our wallet services.
      </p>
      
      <h2 style={{ fontSize: "20px", marginTop: "20px", marginBottom: "10px" }}>2. Wallet Registration</h2>
      <p>
        To use our wallet services, you must create an account and register for a wallet. You agree to provide accurate, current, 
        and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current, 
        and complete.
      </p>
      
      <h2 style={{ fontSize: "20px", marginTop: "20px", marginBottom: "10px" }}>3. Funding Your Wallet</h2>
      <p>
        You can add funds to your wallet using various payment methods, including credit/debit cards, bank transfers, and other 
        available options. All funds added to your wallet are subject to verification and authorization by your financial institution.
      </p>
      
      <h2 style={{ fontSize: "20px", marginTop: "20px", marginBottom: "10px" }}>4. Using Wallet Funds</h2>
      <p>
        Funds in your wallet can be used to make purchases on our website. The following conditions apply:
      </p>
      <ul style={{ marginLeft: "20px" }}>
        <li>
          <strong>Purchases:</strong> All purchases on our website must be made through wallet funds. Direct payments from
           credit or debit cards, or any other online payment methods, are not accepted.

            This is because the prices of items can be as low as 1 Pakistani Rupee, making it impractical to process such small
            transactions directly through payment gateways. Instead, you can add funds to your wallet, which will be used to
            complete your purchases seamlessly.
            When making a purchase, the total amount will be deducted from your wallet balance. Ensure your wallet has sufficient
            funds for transactions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 style={{ fontSize: "20px", marginTop: "20px", marginBottom: "10px" }}>5. Minimum Recharge Amount</h2>
      <p>
              The minimum amount for wallet recharging is 100 Pakistani Rupees.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ fontSize: "20px", marginTop: "20px", marginBottom: "10px" }}>6. Withdrawal of Funds</h2>
      <p>
            Once funds are added to your wallet, they cannot be withdrawn. Wallet funds are exclusively for making purchases on our
            platform and cannot be transferred back to your bank account or any other withdrawal method.
            Please ensure you fund your wallet thoughtfully, as all deposits are final.
      </p>
      
      <h2 style={{ fontSize: "20px", marginTop: "20px", marginBottom: "10px" }}>7. Refunds and Cancellations</h2>
      <p>
        Refunds for purchases made using wallet funds will be credited back to your wallet. Please note the following conditions:
      </p>
      <ul style={{ marginLeft: "20px" }}>
        <li>If there is no winner applicant chosen by our automated systems, money will be refunded to all applicants.</li>
        <li>There is no refund once you pay or apply for a product.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 style={{ fontSize: "20px", marginTop: "20px", marginBottom: "10px" }}>8. Wallet Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take the security of your wallet seriously and implement various measures to protect your funds and personal information. 
        You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your wallet credentials and for all activities that occur under your wallet account. 
        If you suspect any unauthorized activity, please contact us immediately.
      </p>
      
      <h2 style={{ fontSize: "20px", marginTop: "20px", marginBottom: "10px" }}>9. Inactivity and Closure</h2>
      <p>
        If your wallet remains inactive for an extended period, we may close your wallet account. Prior to closure, we will attempt 
        to notify you using the contact information provided in your account.
      </p>
      
      <h2 style={{ fontSize: "20px", marginTop: "20px", marginBottom: "10px" }}>10. Amendments to Policy</h2>
