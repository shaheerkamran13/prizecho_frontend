            <h2 style={{ color: '#16a085' }}>1. Introduction</h2>

            <h2 style={{ color: '#16a085' }}>3. Mediation</h2>
            <p>
                If a dispute cannot be resolved informally, either party may request mediation. Mediation is a voluntary and confidential process in which a neutral third party (the mediator) helps the parties reach a mutually acceptable resolution. The mediator does not have the authority to impose a decision. The mediation process is as follows:
            </p>

            <h3 style={{ color: '#1abc9c' }}>Step 1: Request Mediation</h3>
            <p>
                Either party can request mediation by providing written notice to the other party. The notice should include a brief description of the dispute and the relief sought.
            </p>

            <h3 style={{ color: '#1abc9c' }}>Step 2: Selection of Mediator</h3>
            <p>
                The parties will agree on a mediator from a list of qualified mediators provided by an independent mediation service. If the parties cannot agree on a mediator, the mediation service will appoint one.
            </p>

            <h3 style={{ color: '#1abc9c' }}>Step 3: Mediation Session</h3>
            <p>
                The mediator will schedule a mediation session at a mutually convenient time and place. The session may be conducted in person, by phone, or by video conference.
            </p>

            <h3 style={{ color: '#1abc9c' }}>Step 4: Mediation Agreement</h3>
            <p>
                If the parties reach a resolution, they will sign a mediation agreement outlining the terms of the settlement. The agreement is binding and enforceable in court.
            </p>

            <h2 style={{ color: '#16a085' }}>4. Arbitration</h2>
            <p>
                If mediation is unsuccessful or not desired, either party may request arbitration. Arbitration is a binding dispute resolution process in which a neutral third party (the arbitrator) hears the evidence and makes a decision. The arbitration process is as follows:
            </p>

            <h3 style={{ color: '#1abc9c' }}>Step 1: Request Arbitration</h3>
            <p>
                Either party can request arbitration by providing written notice to the other party. The notice should include a brief description of the dispute and the relief sought.
            </p>

            <h3 style={{ color: '#1abc9c' }}>Step 2: Selection of Arbitrator</h3>
            <p>
                The parties will agree on an arbitrator from a list of qualified arbitrators provided by an independent arbitration service. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, the arbitration service will appoint one.
            </p>

            <h3 style={{ color: '#1abc9c' }}>Step 3: Arbitration Hearing</h3>
            <p>
                The arbitrator will schedule an arbitration hearing at a mutually convenient time and place. The hearing may be conducted in person, by phone, or by video conference. The parties will have the opportunity to present evidence and arguments.
            </p>

            <h3 style={{ color: '#1abc9c' }}>Step 4: Arbitration Award</h3>
            <p>
                The arbitrator will issue a written decision (the arbitration award) within 10 days of the hearing. The award is final and binding on both parties and can be enforced in court.
